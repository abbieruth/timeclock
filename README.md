I'm building an app that will help me log my hours and calculate my wages accurately and easily. This may take me some time to complete but I want to build well.
It is not even remotely functional yet, but once I get it working, I intend to use it for the following purposes:

1. To log my work hours
2. To calculate my wages based on my hours worked and hourly wage
3. To keep a separate log of paid hours and hours that still need to be paid based on a bi-weekly pay period
4. To practice honesty, integrity, and clarity by keeping easily accessible records of hours and wages

I'm building this for my own personal use so I don't know if it will ever be a published website/app, but once it's finished, anyone will be free to copy my code and make it their own.
I only ask that you never sell, or charge anyone to use, anything you build or deploy based on this code.  It's meant to be free and accessible, I just don't have the knowledge or means to deploy it publicly at this time.
Thank you for your time and interest, and although this is a personal project, I hope the finished product will be of use to more people than just me.
